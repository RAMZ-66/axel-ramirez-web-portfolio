# Future Express Server (Optional)

This folder is a placeholder for a custom Node.js/Express backend you might add later (e.g., image optimizer).

Recommended approach:
- Keep this as a separate service/repo for clarity.
- Deploy on Render, Railway, Fly.io, or a VPS.
- Connect your Next.js front-end to it via environment variables.

This is NOT used by the Next.js app and won't affect Vercel builds.
